Each session will contain exercisers to help you achieve your goals and also will suit any conditions physically and mentally; eg. we can do another exercise with the same amount of benefit that you will enjoy.</p>  
          <p><span>W</span>e can do measurements, look at posturel issues, set goals, before and after shots.
          The session will never be boring or repeatative and you will see weekly improvements.
          Private sessions include 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and if you would like to organise 4+ group private sessions this can be arranged as well.</p>
